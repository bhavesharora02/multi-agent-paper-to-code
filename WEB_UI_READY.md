## 🔍 Multi-Agent Pipeline in Action

When you upload a paper, the system:

1. **Planner Agent** → Orchestrates the entire workflow
2. **Paper Analysis Agent** → Extracts algorithms using LLM
3. **Algorithm Interpretation Agent** → Interprets algorithms
4. **API Mapping Agent** → Maps to framework APIs
5. **Code Integration Agent** → Generates complete codebase
6. **Verification Agent** → (Optional) Validates code
7. **Debugging Agent** → (Optional) Refines if needed

All visible in real-time progress updates!

## 💡 Tips

- **Best Papers:** Use papers with clear algorithm descriptions
- **Framework:** PyTorch works best for neural networks
- **Wait Time:** Free model may be slower, be patient
- **Rate Limits:** If you see 429 errors, wait a minute and try again
